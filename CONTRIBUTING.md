## Dev environment

This project is written in typescript and uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to transpile it to javascript.

After installing the node modules
`npm install` 
watch for code changes with
`npx rollup -c rollup.config.js -w`
and serve the files with
`npx http-server`

open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/example/` in your browser and you should see the changes reflected.
