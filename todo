* PopupFormElement doesn't work as expected (remove from path and poly?)
* marker selection highlighing incorrect
* highlight selected colors
* set default marker when creating markers
* find solution to compare colors ( https://github.com/dsteinman/ts-color-class )
* central point for storing style?
* style form elements when initializing as well
* defaultStyle: L.Style {color: Color, etc}

* change logic so all styleable things are set in layer.options
